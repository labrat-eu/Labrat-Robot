Labrat Robot (lbot) aims to be a minimal robotics framework. It is intended to provide you with the most important features of a robotics project. These include:
 - messaging
    - message recording
    - live and remote message tracing
 - separation of concerns between components

The main goals of the lbot project are:
- to be light weight (the framework should not take up considerable resources)
- to be easy to use (using the framework should not lead to frustration)
    - easy to setup
    - easy to learn
    - low build times
- promote readable code (using the framework should make your code easier to understand)
