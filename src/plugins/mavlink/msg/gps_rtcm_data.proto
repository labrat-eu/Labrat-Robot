The fragment ID specifies which order the fragments should be assembled into a buffer, while the sequence ID is used to detect a mismatch between different buffers. The buffer is considered fully reconstructed when either all 4 fragments are present, or all the fragments before the first fragment with a non full payload is received. This management is used to ensure that normal GPS operation doesn't corrupt RTCM data, and to recover from a unreliable transport delivery order.*/
